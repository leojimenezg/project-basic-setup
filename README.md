## How Does It Work?

**Important:** Please review the supported options and their values in detail. Understanding these is crucial for properly configuring the script to generate your basic project setup.

This script sets up your new project through a three-phase process. While the core setup is largely automated, the initial phase relies entirely on your input through the command line.

1. **User Input and Argument Provision:** This first phase is completely up to you. You will provide the necessary arguments, ensuring they're correctly formatted and valid according to the specified ones latter in this document.
2. **Argument Parsing and Initial Setup (Automatic):** The script automatically parses your provided arguments. It then uses this information (if valid) to begin generating the basic project structure and files.
3. **Templated Document and Directory Generation (Automatic):** Building on the parsed arguments, the script proceeds to automatically create the specified project documents and directory structures based on its internal logic and your given configuration.

To tailor the script's output to your specific needs, you'll work with **five distinct options**, each requiring a valid value:

### Provided Options
**Note:** All options have default values. If you skip any option or provide an unsupported value, its default value will be used. Be aware that default settings might not be optimal for your project type.

* `--nme`: Sets your project's name. It supports blank spaces, hyphens (-), and underscores (_). However, it must be enclosed in quotes if it contains blank spaces.
    * Examples:
        ```bash
        --nme=my-project_name  # Valid project name
        ```
        ```bash
        --nme="my project name"  # Valid project name, must be enclosed in quotes.
        ```
* `--rte`: Specifies the path where the project will be created. You can provide an absolute path or a relative path (e.g., ./). Any non-existent parent directories in the path will be automatically created, and the presence or absence of a trailing slash (e.g., /) does not affect. It also supports blank spaces, hyphens (-), and underscores (_), but must be enclosed in quotes if it contains blank spaces.
    * Examples:
        ```bash
        --rte=./  # The project will use the current path.
        ```
        ```bash
        --rte="users/my_user/new dir/other-dir/projects"  # An absolute path, must be enclosed in quotes if contains blank spaces.
        ```
* `--lng`: Defines the project's primary programming language. This only affects the creation of the main source file (e.g., main.py, main.go).
    * Examples:
        ```bash
        --lng=python  # Creates main file with .py extension.
        ```
        ```bash
        --lng=go  # Creates main file with .go extension.
        ```
* `--lic`: Specifies the project's license to be generated. This is a templated file, and it's the only document type that supports different template versions (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
    * Examples:
        ```bash
        --lic=mit  # Uses the MIT template to create de license.
        ```
        ```bash
        --lic=apache  # Uses the APACHE template to create de license.
        ```
* `--dcs`: Determines which auxiliary documents to generate. You can specify multiple specific documents separated by a comma or generate all supported documents. These are template-based files, each with only one available template version, excepting the license as mentioned above.
    * Examples:
        ```bash
        --dcs=all  # Generates all supported auxiliary files (README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore).
        ```
        ```bash
        --dcs=readme,ignore  # Generates specific auxiliary files (README.md, .gitignore). They must be separated by commas without any blank spaces.
        ```

### Provided Option Values
**Note:** Only three of the five available options require specific-predefined values, the other two options (`--nme`, `--rte`) are completly up to you. Using unsupported values for these options will lead to unexpected (to you) project setups, as they will use their default values.

* `--lng`: Accepts five predefined language values. You can easily add more by modifying the `Setup.languages` table.
    * ***python***
    * ***lua***
    * ***cpp***
    * ***c***
    * ***go***
* `--lic`: Supports two predefined license types. To add more, you'll need to modify the `Setup.licenses` table and create the corresponding template file inside the `./templates/license/` directory.
    * ***mit***
    * ***apache***
* `--dcs`: Accepts four predefined document types. You can easily extend this by modifying the `Setup.documents` table and adding the new template file inside the `./templates/` directory.
    * ***readme***
    * ***license***
    * ***ignore***
    * ***all***

### Default Option Values
**Note:** These default values are applied automatically when an option is either not specified during script execution or provided with an unsupported value.

* `--nme`: ***new-project***
* `--rte`: ***./***
* `--lng`: ***lua***
* `--lic`: ***mit***
* `--dcs`: ***all***

## Script Configuration

This script is primarily optimized for its predefined options and values. While implementing significantly different behavior would require substantial code changes, certain parts are designed for easy modification.

This section focuses exclusively on these areas, guiding you on how to extend or adjust the script's options and features while preserving its core purpose.

### Options Configuration
* The `options` table, located within the `Setup` object, allows you to easily add new command-line options. The script will parse these new options just like the predefined ones. However, any new options you add **must be a string of exactly 3 characters** (e.g., `num`, `usr`). Keep in mind that adding an option here only makes it available for parsing, you'll need to write additional code to implement its specific behavior within the script.
    * Example:
        ```lua
        local Setup = {
            options = { nme = "", rte = "", lng = "", lic = "", dcs = "", usr = "" }, -- Example: "usr" option added.
        }

        function Setup.work_with_new_opt(self)
            print(self.options["usr"])
        end
        ```
* Related to the `options` table, the `default_values` table (also within the `Setup` object) is where you can modify the default value assigned to each option. Crucially, any new options you add to the `options` table **must also have a corresponding default value** defined here. Always ensure that the default values you set are valid and compatible with the script's intended logic.
    * Example:
        ```lua
        local Setup = {
            default_values = { nme = "new-project", rte = "./", lng = "lua", lic = "mit", dcs = "all", usr = "me" }, -- Example: "usr" default added.
        }
        ```
### Languages Configuration
* The `languages` table, found within the `Setup` object, lets you easily add new programming language extensions. These extensions are used when generating the main project file. You can add as many languages as you need without requiring any further script changes. Just make sure the language extension is correct and follows the proper format.
    * Example:
        ```lua
        local Setup = {
            languages = { python = "py", lua = "lua", cpp = "cpp", c = "c", go = "go", javascript = "js" }, -- Example: "javascript" language added.
        }
        ```
### Documents Configuration
**Note:** All templates used for document generation must have the `.txt` extension.
* The `documents` table, located within the `Setup` object, allows you to easily add new project documents for generation. For each new document, the option's name must be the **template name** (without its extension), and its assigned value must be the **exact output filename** (including its extension) that the file will be generated with. Remember to also place the corresponding template file inside the `./templates/` project directory.
    * Example:
        ```lua
        local Setup = {
            documents = { readme = "README.md", license = "LICENSE", ignore = ".gitignore", all = "all", script = "my_script.sh" }, -- Example: "script" document added.
        }

        -- Inside "./templates/" place your template file.
        -- Example: "./templates/script.txt".
        ```
### Licenses Configuration
**Note:** All templates used for license generation must have the `.txt` extension and must be placed inside the `./templates/license/` project directory.
* The `licenses` table, found within the `Setup` object, allows you to easily add new project licenses for generation. Unlike the **Documents Configuration**, here the key for each new license **must be the exact template filename** (without its `.txt` extension), corresponding to the template file in your `/templates/license/` directory. The assigned value (e.g., `"MIT"`, `"GPL"`) is typically used for internal referencing or display, as the generated license file will always be named `LICENSE`. Remember to place the corresponding template file inside the `./templates/license/` project directory.
    * Example:
        ```lua
        local Setup = {
            licenses = { mit = "MIT", apache = "APACHE", gpl = "GPL" }, -- Example: "gpl" license added.
        }

        -- Inside "./templates/license/" place your license template file.
        -- Example: "./templates/license/gpl.txt".
        ```

## Notes

* This project originated from my personal need to automate my own project creation process. While developed for specific needs, I've tried to design it to be as versatile as possible, aiming to support a wide range of similar scenarios for basic project setup.
* This script is built on the principle of providing a simple yet fully functional project structure, ideal for straightforward setups. It doesn't aim to manage highly complex or deeply nested project architectures.
* I've tested this project across various scenarios, and it performs as expected when used with its intended options and values. However, deviating significantly from its design may result in either a partially usable or a completely unworkable project setup. Therefore, ensure you use the script as intended.
* Ironically, I didn't use this script to generate its own project structure, as it simply didn't exist yet! However, I definitely plan to use it for my future projects and will continue to improve it as needed.
* **Tip**: Don't hesitate to refactor your code. Often, a clearer vision for your project emerges after the initial implementation, making a second pass highly beneficial (actually proved).
